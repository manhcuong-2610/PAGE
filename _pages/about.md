My name is Manh-Cuong Nguyen. I'm a Masterâ€™s student in Data Analytics for Economics and Finance at the University of Glasgow (U.K.). I'm passionate about financial econometrics, applied statistics, and advanced methods in machine learning and deep learning. I also have a keen interest in forecasting through time series analysis, focusing on modelling and predicting financial trends.
