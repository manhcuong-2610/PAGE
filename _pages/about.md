Welcome to my personal website. My name is **Manh-Cuong Nguyen**, and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in **Data Analytics for Economics and Finance** at the University of Glasgow (U.K.).

My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of **financial econometrics**, **applied statistics**, and advanced methods in **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)**.

I am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to address complex economic and financial challenges.
